"""Interactive shell for the `xl` package. It can be invoked as:

    python -m xl.shell

The shell mimics the normal Python REPL, but performs additional set-up for convenient usage of `xl`.
    - `xl` is imported
    - An empty Excel workbook is opened, if no others are present
    - Open Excel workbooks are assigned variables (workbook, workbook_1, etc.).
      Each such variable and its workbook's name are printed in a table"""
