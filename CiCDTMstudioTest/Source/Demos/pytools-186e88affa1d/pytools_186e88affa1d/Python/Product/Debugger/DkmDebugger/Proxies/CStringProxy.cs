                // In Python 2.x, the story is complicated, since char* is just mapped to non-Unicode Python strings, without any
                // implication of what encoding it may be in. If user then converts this string to Unicode, sys.getdefaultencoding()

                // more often than not never happens. It's fairly common for a native extension to return a string that's encoded in
                // the MBCS for the current locale, and for Python code receiving that string to just pass it through, e.g. printing
                // it to stdout, which also uses locale encoding - or, in general, to treat it as an opaque, 8-bit-clean non-Unicode
                // string. So treating all strings as ASCII or UTF-8 would be incorrect in most cases.
                //
                // So the best thing we can do here for 2.x is to preserve the 8-bit code points as is (which is what encoding using
                // Latin-1 will do, since all 8-bit characters map to exact same code points in Unicode). Then, when we display this
                // string to the user using ReplBuilder, we will use \x## escapes for the higher 128 chars, which will result in a
