    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

You can loop over a list in reverse by using
``{% for obj in list reversed %}``.

You can also unpack multiple values from a two-dimensional array::

    {% for key,value in dict.items %}
        {{ key }}: {{ value }}
    {% endfor %}

The ``for`` tag can take an optional ``{% empty %}`` clause that will
be displayed if the given array is empty or could not be found::

    <ul>
        {% for athlete in athlete_list %}
        <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
        {% empty %}
        <li>Sorry, no athletes in this list.</li>
        {% endfor %}
    <ul>

The above is equivalent to -- but shorter, cleaner, and possibly faster
than -- the following::

    <ul>
        {% if althete_list %}
        {% for athlete in athlete_list %}
            <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        {% else %}
        <li>Sorry, no athletes in this list.</li>
        {% endif %}
    </ul>

The for loop sets a number of variables available within the loop:

    Variable                    Description
    ==========================  ================================================
    ``forloop.counter``         The current iteration of the loop (1-indexed)
    ``forloop.counter0``        The current iteration of the loop (0-indexed)
    ``forloop.revcounter``      The number of iterations from the end of the
                                loop (1-indexed)
    ``forloop.revcounter0``     The number of iterations from the end of the
                                loop (0-indexed)
    ``forloop.first``           True if this is the first time through the loop
    ``forloop.last``            True if this is the last time through the loop

    {% elif athlete_in_locker_room_list %}
        Athletes should be out of the locker room soon!
    {% else %}
        No athletes.
    {% endif %}

In the above, if ``athlete_list`` is not empty, the number of athletes will
be displayed by the ``{{ athlete_list|count }}`` variable.

As you can see, the ``if`` tag may take one or several `` {% elif %}``
clauses, as well as an ``{% else %}`` clause that will be displayed if all
previous conditions fail. These clauses are optional.

``if`` tags may use ``or``, ``and`` or ``not`` to test a number of
variables or to negate a given variable::

    {% if not athlete_list %}
        There are no athletes.
    {% endif %}

    {% if athlete_list or coach_list %}
        There are some athletes or some coaches.
    {% endif %}

    {% if athlete_list and coach_list %}
        Both atheletes and coaches are available.
    {% endif %}

    {% if not athlete_list or coach_list %}
        There are no athletes, or there are some coaches.
    {% endif %}

    {% if athlete_list and not coach_list %}
        There are some athletes and absolutely no coaches.

Comparison operators are also available, and the use of filters is also
allowed, for example::

    {% if articles|length >= 5 %}...{% endif %}

Arguments and operators _must_ have a space between them, so
``{% if 1>2 %}`` is not a valid if tag.

All supported operators are: ``or``, ``and``, ``in``, ``not in``
``==`` (or ``=``), ``!=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<`` and ``<=``.

Operator precedence follows Python."}, 
                {"ifchanged", @"Checks if a value has changed from the last iteration of a loop.

The ``{% ifchanged %}`` block tag is used within a loop. It has two
possible uses.

1. Checks its own rendered contents against its previous state and only
    displays the content if it has changed. For example, this displays a
    list of days, only displaying the month if it changes::

        <h1>Archive for {{ year }}</h1>

        {% for date in days %}
            {% ifchanged %}<h3>{{ date|date:""F"" }}</h3>{% endifchanged %}
            <a href=""{{ date|date:""M/d""|lower }}/"">{{ date|date:""j"" }}</a>
        {% endfor %}

2. If given one or more variables, check whether any variable has changed.
    For example, the following shows the date every time it changes, while
    showing the hour if either the hour or the date has changed::

        {% for date in days %}
            {% ifchanged date.date %} {{ date.date }} {% endifchanged %}
            {% ifchanged date.hour date.date %}
                {{ date.hour }}
            {% endifchanged %}

Like a simple ""include"" tag, the ``ssi`` tag includes the contents
of another file -- which must be specified using an absolute path --
in the current page::

    {% ssi /home/html/ljworld.com/includes/right_generic.html %}

If the optional ""parsed"" parameter is given, the contents of the included
file are evaluated as template code, with the current context::

    {% ssi /home/html/ljworld.com/includes/right_generic.html parsed %}"}, 
                {"load", @"Loads a custom template tag set.

                {"now", @"Displays the date, formatted according to the given string.

Sample usage::

    It is {% now ""jS F Y H:i"" %}"}, 
                {"regroup", @"Regroups a list of alike objects by a common attribute.

This complex tag is best illustrated by use of an example:  say that
``people`` is a list of ``Person`` objects that have ``first_name``,
``last_name``, and ``gender`` attributes, and you'd like to display a list
that looks like:

    * Male:
        * George Bush
        * Bill Clinton
    * Female:
        * Margaret Thatcher
        * Colendeeza Rice
    * Unknown:
        * Pat Smith

The following snippet of template code would accomplish this dubious task::

    {% regroup people by gender as grouped %}
    <ul>
    {% for group in grouped %}
        <li>{{ group.grouper }}
        <ul>
            {% for item in group.list %}
            <li>{{ item }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

As you can see, ``{% regroup %}`` populates a variable with a list of
objects with ``grouper`` and ``list`` attributes.  ``grouper`` contains the
item that was grouped by; ``list`` contains the list of objects that share
that ``grouper``.  In this case, ``grouper`` would be ``Male``, ``Female``
and ``Unknown``, and ``list`` is the list of people with those genders.

Note that ``{% regroup %}`` does not work when the list to be grouped is not
sorted by the key you are grouping by!  This means that if your list of
people was not sorted by gender, you'd need to make sure it is sorted
before using it, i.e.::

    {% regroup people|dictsort:""gender"" by gender as grouped %}"}, 
                {"spaceless", @"Removes whitespace between HTML tags, including tab and newline characters.

    Example usage::

                <a href=""fob/"">Fob</a>
            </p>
        {% endspaceless %}

    This example would return this HTML::

        <p><a href=""fob/"">Fob</a></p>

    Only space between *tags* is normalized -- not space between tags and text.
    In this example, the space around ``Hello`` won't be stripped::

        {% spaceless %}
            <strong>
                Hello

configuration::

The first argument is a path to a view. It can be an absolute python path
or just ``app_name.view_name`` without the project name if the view is
located inside the project.  Other arguments are comma-separated values
that will be filled in place of positional and keyword arguments in the
URL. All arguments for the URL should be present.

For example if you have a view ``app_name.client`` taking client's id and
the corresponding line in a URLconf looks like this::

    ('^client/(\d+)/$', 'app_name.client')

and this app's URLconf is included into the project's URLconf under some
path::

    ('^clients/', include('project_name.app_name.urls'))

then in a template you can create a link for a certain client like this::

    {% url app_name.client client.id %}
