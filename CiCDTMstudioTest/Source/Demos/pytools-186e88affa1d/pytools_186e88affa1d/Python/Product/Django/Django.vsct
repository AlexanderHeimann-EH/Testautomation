  <!--  This is the file that defines the actual layout and type of the commands.
        It is divided in different sections (e.g. command definition, command
        placement, ...), with each defining a specific set of properties.
        See the comment before each section for more details about how to
        use it. -->

  <!--  The VSCT compiler (the tool that translates this file into the binary 
        format that VisualStudio will consume) has the ability to run a preprocessor 
        on the vsct file; this preprocessor is (usually) the C++ preprocessor, so 
        it is possible to define includes and macros with the same syntax used 
        in C++ files. Using this ability of the compiler here, we include some files 
        defining some of the constants that we will use inside the file. -->

  <!--The Commands section is where we the commands, menus and menu groups are defined.
      This section uses a Guid to identify the package that provides the command defined inside it. -->
  <Commands package="guidDjangoPkg">
    <!-- Inside this section we have different sub-sections: one for the menus, another  
    for the menu groups, one for the buttons (the actual commands), one for the combos 
    and the last one for the bitmaps used. Each element is identified by a command id that  
    is a unique pair of guid and numeric identifier; the guid part of the identifier is usually  
    called "command set" and is used to group different command inside a logically related  
    group; your package should define its own command set in order to avoid collisions  
    with command ids defined by other packages. -->

  <!--  Within this section you can specify the set of commands defined somewhere else that your  
        packages uses; for instance if your package uses the standard ‘Copy’ command, you don’t  
        need to define it, because it is defined by the shell, but you have to use this section  
        of the VSCT file to notify the shell that your package uses it using this section. -->
  <!--  Note that with combo boxes we have effectively two commands in one. Below 
        we have two pairs of commands; 1st pair commandIDFontName and commandIDFontNameHandler, 
        2nd pair commandIDFontSize and commandIDFontSizeHandler. Note that: 
        
        - commandIDFontName and commandIDFontSize handle the displaying and setting of the font 
          name and font size respectively 
        - commandIDFontNameHandler and commandIDFontSizeHandler fill the drop down menus 
          with the available font names and font sizes respectively 
     -->

  <!--Inside this section, we have the ability to place menu groups inside some other menu or 
      menu / commands inside other groups. 
      For instance, it is possible to place one of VisualStudio's menus or commands inside one of our  
      groups or one of our groups inside a menu defined somewhere else. -->
