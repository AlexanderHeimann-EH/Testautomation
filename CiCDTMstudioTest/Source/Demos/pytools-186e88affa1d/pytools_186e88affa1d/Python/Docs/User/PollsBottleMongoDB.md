Bottle and MongoDB on Azure
===========================

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple polls application using one of the 
PTVS sample templates.

The polls application defines an abstraction for its repository, so you can 
easily switch between different types of repositories (In-Memory, Azure Table 
Storage, MongoDB).

We'll learn how to use one of the hosted MongoDB services on Azure, how to 
configure the application to use MongoDB, and how to publish the application 
to an Azure Website.

## Prerequisites

 - Visual Studio 2012 or 2013
 - [PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707)
 - [PTVS 2.1 Samples VSIX](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707)
 - [Azure SDK Tools for VS 2013](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=323510) or 
   [Azure SDK Tools for VS 2012](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=323511)
 - [Python 2.7 32-bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/python-2.7.8.msi) or 
   [Python 3.4 32-bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.1/python-3.4.1.msi)


## Create the Project

In this section, we'll create a Visual Studio project using a sample template. 
We'll create a virtual environment and install required packages.  Then we'll 
run the application locally using the default in-memory repository.

1. In Visual Studio, select **File**, **New Project**.

1. The project templates from the PTVS Samples VSIX are available under 
   **Python**, **Samples**.  Select **Polls Bottle Web Project** and click OK 
   to create the project.

  ![New Project](Images/PollsBottleNewProject.png)

1. You will be prompted to install external packages.  Select **Install into a 
   virtual environment**.

  ![External Packages](Images/PollsBottleExternalPackages.png)

1. Select **Python 2.7** or **Python 3.4** as the base interpreter.

  ![Add Virtual Env](Images/PollsCommonAddVirtualEnv.png)

1. Confirm that the application works by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>.  By default,
   the application uses an in-memory repository which doesn't require any 
   configuration.  All data is lost when the web server is stopped.

1. Click **Create Sample Polls**, then click on a poll and vote.

## Create a MongoDB Database

For the database, we'll create a MongoLab hosted database on Azure.

As an alternative, you can create your own Virtual Machine running on Azure, 
then install and administer MongoDB yourself.

You can create a free trial with MongoLab by following these steps.

1. Log into the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).

1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click **NEW**.

  ![New](Images/PollsCommonAzurePlusNew.png)

1. Click **STORE**, then **MongoLab**.

  ![MongoLab Step 1](Images/PollsCommonMongoLabAddon1.png)

1. In Name, type a name to use for the database service.

1. Choose a Region/Affinity Group in which to locate the database service. If 
   you will be using the database from your Azure application, select the same 
   region where you will deploy your application.

  ![MongoLab Step 2](Images/PollsCommonMongoLabAddon2.png)

1. Click **PURCHASE**.


## Configure the Project

In this section, we'll configure our application to use the MongoDB database 
we just created.  We'll see how to obtain connection settings from the Azure 
portal.  Then we'll run the application locally.

1. In [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com), click on 
   **ADD-ONS**, then click on the MongoLab service you created earlier.

1. Click on **CONNECTION INFO**.  You can use the copy button to put the value 
   of **MONGOLAB_URI** on the clipboard.

  ![Manage Access Keys](Images/PollsCommonMongoLabConnectionInfo.png)

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on your project node in Solution Explorer and 
   select **Properties**.  Click on the **Debug** tab.

  ![Environment Variables](Images/PollsBottleMongoDBProjectDebugSettings.png)

1. Set the values of environment variables required by the application in 
   **Debug Server Command**, **Environment**.

  ```
  REPOSITORY_NAME=mongodb
  MONGODB_HOST=<value of MONGOLAB_URI>
  MONGODB_DATABASE=<database name>
  ```

  This will set the environment variables when you **Start Debugging**.  If you 
  want the variables to be set when you **Start Without Debugging**, set the 
  same values under **Run Server Command** as well.

  Alternatively, you can define environment variables using the Windows Control 
  Panel.  This is a better option if you want to avoid storing credentials in 
  source code / project file.  Note that you will need to restart Visual Studio 
  for the new environment values to be available to the application.

1. The code that implements the MongoDB repository is in **models/mongodb.py**.

1. Run the application with <kbd>F5</kbd>.  Polls that are created with 
   **Create Sample Polls** and the data submitted by voting will be serialized 
   in MongoDB.

1. Browse to the **About** page to verify that the application is using the 
   **MongoDB** repository.

  ![Web Browser](Images/PollsBottleMongoDBAbout.png)


## Explore the MongoDB Database

You can use an application such as [RoboMongo](http://robomongo.org/) to query 
and make edits to a MongoDB database.  In this section we'll use RoboMongo to 
view the contents of the polls application database.

1. Create a new connection.  You'll need the **MONGOLAB_URI** we retrieved in 
   the previous section.

   Note the format of the URI: `mongodb://<name>:<password>@<address>:<port>/<name>`

   The name matches the name you entered when you created the service with 
   Azure.  It is used for both the database name and the user name.

1. In the connection page, set the **Name** to any name you would like for the 
   connection.  Also set the **Address** and **Port** fields to the *address* 
   and *port* from **MONGOLAB_URI**.

  ![Robomongo Connection 1](Images/PollsCommonRobomongoCreateConnection1.png)

1. In the authentication page, set the **Database** and **User name** to the 
   *name* from **MONGOLAB_URI**.  Also set the **Password** to the *password* 
   from **MONGOLAB_URI**.

  ![Robomongo Connection 2](Images/PollsCommonRobomongoCreateConnection2.png)

1. Save and connect to the database.  You can now query the polls collection.

  ![Robomongo Query](Images/PollsCommonRobomongoQuery.png)


## Publish to an Azure Website

PTVS provides an easy way to deploy your web application to an Azure Website.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the project node and select 
   **Publish**.

  ![Publish](Images/PollsCommonPublishWebSiteDialog.png)

1. Click on **Microsoft Azure Websites**.

1. Click on **New** to create a new site.

1. Select a **Site name** and a **Region** and click **Create**.

  ![Create Web Site](Images/PollsCommonCreateWebSite.png)

1. Accept all other defaults and click **Publish**.

1. Your web browser will open automatically to the published site.  If you 
   browse to the about page, you'll see that it uses the **In-Memory** repository, 
   not the **MongoDB** repository.

   That's because the environment variables are not set on the Azure Website, 
   so it uses the default values specified in **settings.py**.

## Configure the Azure Website

In this section, we'll configure environment variables for the site.

1. In [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com), click on the 
   site created in the previous section.

1. In the top menu, click on **CONFIGURE**.

  ![Configure](Images/PollsCommonWebSiteTopMenu.png)

1. Scroll down to the **app settings** section and set the values for 
   **REPOSITORY_NAME**, **MONGODB_HOST** and **MONGODB_DATABASE** as described 
   in the section above.

  ![App Settings](Images/PollsCommonWebSiteConfigureSettingsMongoDB.png)

1. In the bottom menu, click on **SAVE**, then **RESTART** and finally 
   **BROWSE**.

  ![Save](Images/PollsCommonWebSiteConfigureBottomMenu.png)

1. You should see the application working as expected, using the **MongoDB** 
   repository.

   Congratulations!
