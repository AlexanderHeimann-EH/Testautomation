TODO:(pv)
	* Consider fully implementing the [python] post-review in this C# app
		There is no real need to *call* post-review, when it can be directly replace.

			* Get titles for reviews
			* Get user review lists
			* Get review groups/users
			* Directly publish review


Install VisualStudio 2008 SDK 1.1.
